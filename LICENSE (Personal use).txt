# OPENTYPE VARIATIONS DEMO LICENSE

## End User License Agreement

This End User License Agreement is a legal agreement between you and DJR (David Jonathan Ross). Please read it carefully.

This license allows you to use the font for personal/internal use only, and for public demos of OpenType Font Variations.

When you purchase a font from DJR, you are granted a non-exclusive license to use the font in your work.

This agreement takes effect when you download or use the font. If you do not agree to or understand these terms, do not download and/or use the font.

Fonts: For the purposes of this license, a “font” is defined as the font software, the designs embodied therein, and all supplemental materials provided along with the font software, as well as any future versions or upgrades.

## General Terms

You are permitted to use the font for personal use and for public demos of OpenType Font Variations technology.

Protection: This font is protected under United States copyright and trademark law.

Distribution: Except in very specific instances described and permitted in this license, you may not distribute (share, rent, lend, give away, or sell) the font. You agree to take all reasonable steps to prevent others from accessing, distributing, or re-serving the font file.

Modifications: Conversion to outlined vector files is permitted. You may also modify the font software itself, as long as it is for your own purposes only and you do not distribute the modified font or the software. Any derived versions from the font remain the property of DJR and are subject to the same license. Please contact DJR and explain the nature of the modification.

License transfer: You are not allowed to transfer this license.

Other uses: Please contact DJR and obtain a special license if you wish to use the fonts in desktop publishing, web publishing, branding, or any other way than personal/internal use.

Credit: Please credit DJR when using the font in any public setting.


## Terms of Desktop Use

This license allows you to install and use the font on a limited number of workstations defined in your order summary. All of these workstations must belong to the same individual, company, or organization that is licensing the font.

Document Embedding: You are allowed to embed the font in document formats that allow embedding, such as PDF. The font must be embedded in such a way that the reader is restricted from changing its embedding permissions, extracting the complete font from the document, and create or edit new content using the font. Embedding in mobile apps or e-books is subject to a separate set of terms and is subject to separate limitations.

Service Bureaus: If printing from an embedded PDF is not an option, you are permitted to send the font to a printer or service bureau that is creating the final output of your design. When the service bureau is finished printing your job, they must destroy all copies of the font.

Internal Servers: You may install the font on an internal server as long as you do not exceed the total number of users defined in your order summary.

Backups: You may create a copy of the desktop font for backup purposes, as long as the backup copy cannot be accessed by anyone other than licensed users.


## Terms of Web Use

This license allows you to use the font on websites using CSS @font-face, so long as that website is specifically intended to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenType Font Variations technology.

Domains: You are required to identify and register all domains where the font is served via @font-face with DJR. Please contact DJR at (david@djr.com) at any time to notify him of additional domains. 

Server: You must host the font on your website’s server or on a CDN (content delivery network) where you host other website assets. You must make a reasonable effort to prevent unlicensed use of the fonts by other people.


## Finally

Rights: DJR reserves all rights not otherwise specified, makes no guarantees, and disclaims all warranties except those proscribed by law.

Liability: Under no circumstances is DJR responsible or liable for any issues or harm or physical damages that may result from the use of the font, even if notified in advance.

If you encounter a problem with the font, DJR will make a good faith effort to provide you with documentation and support. If no solution can be found, DJR may offer you the option to terminate the license in exchange for a refund. A refund is not guaranteed and is completely up to DJR’s discretion.

Termination: DJR reserves the right to terminate this license if you breach any term without the obligation of notice or opportunity to cure. If your license is terminated, you are obligated to destroy all copies of the font that you possess.

Grounds for termination include:

* Using the font outside of the terms set in this license
* Exceeding the agreed-upon limitations without purchasing an upgrade
* Unauthorized distribution of the font or other breaches of the terms stated above

Legal Use: DJR reserves all rights to modify, enforce, and terminate this license to the extent that it is permitted by law. You are responsible for making sure that you are in compliance with all laws, foreign and domestic, that might apply to its purchase and use.

Questions: If you have any questions or concerns about this license, contact DJR at any time at (david@djr.com).
